\f0\fs24 \cf0 # Key Findings \'96 E-Commerce Operations Analysis\
\
## 1. Strong Average Performance Masks Tail Risk\
Weekly SLA analysis shows consistently high on-time delivery rates (generally above 90%).  \
However, p90 lead time reaches up to 30\'9637 days in certain weeks, indicating that a subset of customers experiences significantly longer delivery times as operational load increases.\
\
This demonstrates that average-based metrics alone are insufficient for monitoring operational risk.\
\

\
## 2. Conservative SLA Promises with High Variability\
Average delivery delay is negative across most cities, meaning orders are often delivered earlier than the estimated delivery date.  \
While this reflects conservative SLA promises, on-time delivery rates vary widely across cities (approximately 72%\'9685%), suggesting inconsistencies in delivery time estimation rather than delivery speed.\
\

\
## 3. Significant Regional Differences in Delivery Performance\
Delivery performance differs substantially by state and city, even within the same region.  \
Some cities consistently underperform in on-time rate and p90 delay metrics, pointing to localized operational constraints such as carrier capacity, distance, or infrastructure limitations.\
\
This highlights the importance of region-level performance monitoring rather than relying on national averages.\
\

\
## 4. Order Value Is Not the Primary Driver of Delays\
High-value orders do not exhibit significantly worse average delivery delays compared to lower-value orders.  \
Delay variability appears to be driven more by regional logistics factors than by order value or basket size alone.\
\
This suggests that logistics optimization efforts should prioritize regional bottlenecks over value-based segmentation.\
